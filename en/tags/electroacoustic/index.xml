This encounter between electroacoustic tradition and digital interactivity opens fascinating perspectives for contemporary sound art.
When the Invisible Becomes Playable Acousmatic music, the art of pure listening freed from visual sources, shares a fundamental characteristic with video games: the creation of imaginary universes through sound. In my interactive works, this approach allows listeners to discover the richness of electroacoustic composition through an immersive artistic experience.</description></item><item><title>What is Acousmatic Music?</title><link>http://jcploquin.free.fr/en/blog/what-is-acousmatic-music/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://jcploquin.free.fr/en/blog/what-is-acousmatic-music/</guid><description>Acousmatic music remains one of the most mysterious and fascinating currents in contemporary sound creation.

The Determining Influence of Francis Faber Francis Faber, my former teacher, planted the first seeds of my fascination with interactive art through his installation &amp;ldquo;Totem&amp;rdquo;. This revolutionary work made me understand that music could transcend the traditional concert framework to become an immersive and participatory experience.</description></item></channel></rss>

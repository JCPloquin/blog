## Biography

Electroacoustic composer and guitarist, I am passionate about musical creation in all its forms: from fingerpicking blues and Celtic music to acousmatic music, including contemporary composition and interactive installations.

After studying musicology and winning first prize in electroacoustics at the Dieppe conservatory, I explored the live scene, radio creation on Second Life, Celtic music with Normainn, then science fiction writing.

My artistic universe, nourished by family tradition and technological innovation, oscillates between transmission, experimentation and sound immersion.

## An exceptional musical heritage

Music has been flowing in my veins for several generations. Besides my grandfather and my father, both passionate pianists, my family also includes prominent figures from the French musical scene.

Among them, **Mathurin François Furic**, better known as **Matilin an Dall** ("Mathurin the blind"), is undoubtedly the most legendary. Born in Quimperlé in 1789, becoming blind at a very young age, he established himself as one of the greatest bombard players in Brittany. A true virtuoso, he played at all the great Breton festivals, but also before political personalities and even before Napoleon III during his visit to Quimper in 1858.

> *"Celtic Paganini, king of the gavotte, genius of the Breton oboe... Matilin an Dall marked his era and left an indelible mark on traditional music."*  
> — Pierre Larousse, Grand Universal Dictionary of the 19th Century

He inspired many writers and musicians, and his name remains associated with excellence and Breton musical tradition.

My great-great-aunt, Marthe Ploquin, was also a recognized figure in the La Rochelle musical world, both as a pianist and as a singer, famous for her charity concerts for the benefit of Great War soldiers. Her commitment and talent are still praised today, as evidenced by a recent article from the Departmental Archives of Charente-Maritime:

The local press was full of praise for her performances:

> *"Miss Ploquin made us admire her remarkable technique. She easily handled the double-note passages of the Andante and brilliantly performed the Allegro and Presto. An intelligent interpreter, Miss Ploquin dazzled us with her virtuosity."*  
> — Le Courrier de La Rochelle, December 13, 1919

**This family heritage, made of passion, transmission and commitment, continues to inspire my own artistic journey.**

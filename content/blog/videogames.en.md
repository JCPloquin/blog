Long confined to concert halls and artistic installations, acousmatic music today finds an unexpected field of expression: video games. This encounter between electroacoustic tradition and digital interactivity opens fascinating perspectives for contemporary sound art.

## When the Invisible Becomes Playable

Acousmatic music, the art of pure listening freed from visual sources, shares a fundamental characteristic with video games: **the creation of imaginary universes through sound**. In my interactive works, this approach allows listeners to discover the richness of electroacoustic composition through an immersive artistic experience.

**Points of convergence:**
- **Total immersion**: The player dives into a sonic bath like the listener of an acousmatic work
- **3D spatialization**: Multichannel diffusion techniques find their equivalent in 3D audio for games
- **Sonic narration**: Soundscapes tell stories without words
- **Contemplative interactivity**: The player's action influences musical evolution

## "Playing Music": An Artistic Revelation

It was the expression **"playing music"** that opened this creative path for me. If one can "play" an instrument, why couldn't one "play" an electroacoustic composition? The video game medium, initially designed for entertainment, then becomes an **artistic medium** for my interactive experiments.

This approach radically transforms the relationship to the work: the listener becomes **interpreter** of their own musical experience, exploring the nuances and subtleties of acousmatic composition through their actions.

## The Legacy of Electroacoustic Pioneers

Composers like Pierre Schaeffer or Denis Smalley developed sound morphology techniques that today find their application in my interactive creations. The notion of **sound object** becomes **playable element**, **acousmatic diffusion** transforms into **immersive experience**.

## Experimenting with Acousmatic Phrasing: The Example of Music & Me

In *Music & Me*, the listener experiments with **acousmatic phrasing** through the chaining of more or less controllable sound object triggers. The work progresses pedagogically:

- **Solo**: Learning to trigger and control individual sound objects
- **Duo**: Experimenting with interaction between two sound sources
- **Trio**: Developing polyphonic complexity
- **Quartet**: Mastering acousmatic polyphony and active listening

This progression allows exploring the fundamentals of electroacoustic composition: articulation, sound morphology, and construction of musical discourse through object assembly.

## Experimenting with Spatialization: The Example of Ascendance

In *Ascendance*, it's **spatialization** that we experiment with, through moving the listening point in a sound space too large to be grasped all at once. The listener navigates in a genealogical universe where each ancestor generates their own sound objects - bells, choirs, trumpets - distributed in space according to family relationships.

This approach reveals the subtleties of **acousmatic diffusion**: sonic perspective, depth of field, and construction of space through sound.

## Full-Fledged Works of Art

**My interactive creations are:**
- **Electroacoustic compositions** using interactivity as an expressive parameter
- **Artistic experiences** where listening becomes performance
- **Unique works** that question the boundaries between composer and interpreter
- **Sound laboratories** where each interaction reveals new musical aspects

*Music & Me* and *Ascendance* are not "musical games" but **interactive acousmatic works** that use the video game medium to explore new forms of artistic expression.

## Technical Innovation in Service of Art

**My works exploit:**
- **Controlled triggering of sound objects**: To experiment with acousmatic phrasing
- **Adaptive spatialization**: The sound environment adapts to the listener's movements
- **Interactive polyphony**: Real-time construction of complex textures
- **Spatial navigation**: Exploration of impossible sound spaces

## Toward a New Form of Acousmatic Art

Interactive acousmatic music doesn't just illustrate action: it **becomes** the action. The listener no longer passively consumes a work, they participate in its real-time creation. This approach questions the boundaries between composer, interpreter, and listener.

**The future of this convergence:**
- **Acousmatic virtual reality**: Total immersion in impossible sound universes
- **Creative artificial intelligence**: Procedural generation of electroacoustic works
- **Online musical collaboration**: Co-creation of shared sound universes
- **Interactive installations**: Reactive sound art spaces

## A New Artistic Language

For today's electroacoustic composers, interactivity represents a **new artistic language**. It allows exploring unprecedented forms of composition, creating evolving works, and fundamentally rethinking the relationship between creator and receiver.

This approach doesn't "democratize" acousmatic music: it **reinvents** it as living and participatory art.

## Listening as Performance

In this new form of acousmatic art, **listening becomes performance**. The fineness of sound perception and sensitivity to nuances determine the richness of the artistic experience. The listener develops an intimate relationship with the work, becoming co-creator of their own aesthetic experience.

Interactive acousmatic music thus opens a promising path for the evolution of contemporary sound art, creating bridges between experimental tradition and digital expression.

## Hydrophonia

My latest symphonic poem created for the Nautil'Art 2023 Festival at the Halle aux Toiles in Rouen.

This 60-minute composition explores the aquatic element through four cyclical movements with no defined beginning or end.

**I. Aquastasis** - The primordial aquatic balance  
**II. Cosmogenesis** - The cosmic birth of waters  
**III. Exolvuntur** - The evolution of aquatic forms  
**IV. Fons Vitae** - The universal source of life
